When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	+ When I need to collaborate with others in a project environment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	+ In a collaborative mode, whatever the size of project,
	   it allow local-repository-user to control his/her master version.
	   
Describe the differences between fork, clones and branches.
When would you use one instead of another ?

	  Clone is the term used to refer 'cloning' between
			(1) GitHub --> PC/Laptop
			(2) PC/Laptop --> PC/Laptop.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	+ Can work off-line with the latest remote copy.
	+ Can see the differences between what is on remote and locally.
	+ Can merge the changes with the local version and the latest remote version.
