When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	+ When I need to collaborate with others in a project environment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	+ In a collaborative mode, whatever the size of project,
	   it allow local-repository-user to control his/her master version.
