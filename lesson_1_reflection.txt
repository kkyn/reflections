How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    + use 'git log' --- to show the history of changes
	+ use 'git diff id1 id2' --- to show the differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    + I can make exploratory changes with confidence,
	    knowing I can go back to older stable versions.
